Hey I'm new, why it's showing
"did not match any file known to git"
When i run forge install


[04/03/2025 13:07] 0xredveil
did you run the command in the contracts subfolder?

Please anyone able to run forge coverage without any issue been trying stuck at point with no error message


[04/03/2025 15:35] 0xredveil
What's the issue?


[04/03/2025 15:36] sulaimon3546
Can't run forge coverage just stuck with no error message


[04/03/2025 15:41] 0xredveil
Mhmm didn't encounter that yet. What's your forge version?


[04/03/2025 15:47] sulaimon3546
forge Version: 1.0.0-stable


[04/03/2025 15:50] pfapostol
Do you see at least some test logs?


[04/03/2025 15:51] pfapostol
What is the last message before stuck?


[04/03/2025 15:51] sulaimon3546
Yes, i did. i think the issue has to do with invariant test i would look at it


[04/03/2025 15:52] pfapostol
If the tests are running, the problem may be that they are simply taking too long.


[04/03/2025 15:52] pfapostol
It is defenitly long for me on 5700x


[04/03/2025 16:01] pfapostol
took 6 minutes, `forge coverage --ffi --report lcov --lcov-version 2.2  1965.59s user 5.04s system 525% cpu 6:14.85 total`


[04/03/2025 16:25] 0xredveil
Probably the invariant tests


[04/03/2025 16:36] sulaimon3546
Yes its


[04/04/2025 04:17] w33ked_
You know it doesn't run on the gpu. Maybe you can boost cpu usage or optimize wsl performance


[04/04/2025 04:18] pfapostol
5700X is ryzen CPU, and i do not use wsl, i have separate PC for audits


[04/04/2025 04:27] pfapostol
And in general, after running with the resource monitor, I realized that this is not a CPU problem. All threads are loaded by 2-6%. Invariants are simply slowing down for some reason.

[04/04/2025 06:39] w33ked_
Oooh. Sorry I confused the 5700x for the 5070


[04/04/2025 14:46] kvarcheats
i installed everything but when i try to forge build i get 1 million errors and then "Warning (4013): There are more than 256 errors. Aborting."


[04/04/2025 16:13] rashmor01
is code for PoC required?


[04/04/2025 16:17] kartoonjoy
they are recommended for HMs.

those warnings can be ignored they are in tests and scripts


[04/04/2025 17:22] derastephh
cd into contracts and then run forge build

Or too much


[04/04/2025 17:23] 0xredveil
its largely LiquityV2 which is genius but a beast


[04/04/2025 17:23] 0xredveil
if you understand that code ours istn much different but without prior knowledge of LiquityV2 its quite smth indeed


[04/05/2025 11:34] theschnilch
@RedVeil Is there any information about which collateral tokens will be used, apart from the ones that Liquity V2 uses by default (I mean wstETH, rETH, and wETH)? And will it be deployed only on mainnet, or also on other chains?


[04/05/2025 12:33] 0xredveil

are the submitted findings readily available for sponsors? or they need to wait before contest ends to access it?

They get access after submissions close.

HM @🐺Wardens 🔆 

** ‼️ Update re: BitVault submissions access after close**
The BitVault team has requested that we keep submissions private until they have had time to review them in collaboration with the Liquity team, since they are undergoing an audit concurrently. 

Wardens (including SR wardens) will therefore *not* have access to submissions immediately after the submission deadline.

We will keep wardens apprised of progress here, but we wanted to give you a heads-up as the submission deadline approaches.

ℹ️ Wardens, you have about 2 hrs till this audit closes. Be sure to submit your findings well in advance of the cutoff. Thanks!

**🚨 AUDIT ALERT**

@🐺Wardens The **BitVault** audit is now closed! Huge thanks to everyone who participated 🔍, whether you submitted a finding or not.

What's next: The sponsor team and judge will review the findings over the next couple of weeks.


[04/11/2025 23:27] kvarcheats
Are we going to be able to see if our findings are validated or not by the triage

[04/11/2025 23:42] kvarcheats
That does not answer my question. I am not asking for anyone elses findings. Im asking if I can see the triage opinion on mine


[04/11/2025 23:44] kartoonjoy
For the time being you won't see any findings, yours or anyone else's. Does that help?


[04/23/2025 13:14] d.te
Just wondering if there are any updates on the submissions or review process


[04/27/2025 09:49] joshuajee
When is the judging resuming on this one"?


[04/29/2025 16:55] kartoonjoy
Wardens, submissions are now visible.


[04/29/2025 18:49] 0xdemonnn
Just want to give an opinion regarding judging on this contest, please check the primary issue and duplicate issue again. For the primary issue, there is an issue with coded PoC but not selected as primary while the primary issue is non-coded PoC. For duplicate, there is an issue that has a completely different root cause but is made into one issue. 
Thanks. :hi5:


[04/29/2025 21:32] franco_btc
I submitted a medium-severity vulnerability that has three duplicates and is confirmed as valid, but mine is marked as "insufficient" while the other duplicates are marked as "sufficient." What does this mean? Will my vulnerability not be considered?


[04/29/2025 22:58] 0xgeee_68136
hi, i have a question on how the judging works since the ui is very confusing.


[04/29/2025 22:59] 0xgeee_68136
are the status of the reports already final ?


[04/29/2025 23:04] 0xgeee_68136
also who checks the duplications ?


[04/30/2025 00:23] kartoonjoy
Hi there. We're currently in the PJQA phase which means that the statuses are near final pending discussions with SR wardens and the sponsor. The judge is responsible to assigning duplicates.


[04/30/2025 00:59] 0xdemonnn
Hi, what are the criteria for a primary issue to be selected? I am talking about issue [F-74](https://code4rena.com/audits/2025-04-bitvault/submissions/F-74). The current primary issue does not have a coded PoC while there is a duplicate that has a clear coded PoC. Please check again. Thanks.


[04/30/2025 01:07] 0xgeee_68136
so the sponsor initially decides the status of the report ? are we allowed to escalate if we dont agree with the sponsor's decision ?


[04/30/2025 01:10] kartoonjoy
The sponsor weighs in and the judge makes the final decision. Without the SR role, no, you wont be able to escalate.


[04/30/2025 01:10] kartoonjoy
Im not going to speak to specific issues but the judge makes the final determination


[04/30/2025 01:11] 0xgeee_68136
so without escalation, the final judge will be on the sponsor? 🤔


[04/30/2025 01:12] kartoonjoy
The Judge will make the final decision.


[04/30/2025 01:13] 0xgeee_68136
gotcha. what if there are wrong duplicates? i hope the judge will go through all the issues.

{Reactions}
🤞 

[04/30/2025 09:26] 0xgeee_68136
may i ask who is the judge for this contest?


[05/01/2025 09:24] alexzhang8602
In F-15,  I noticed the judge's comment.
 "On reviewing this again in the context of S-195's comments, this really shouldn't be higher than QA given the Centralization Risks rules.". 
However, I think F-15 is different from S-195, and its severity should actually be higher.

According to the Centralization Risks guidelines: "Reckless admin mistakes are invalid."

But the issue in F-15 isn’t a reckless admin mistake. The protocol never accounted for this scenario, so the admin wouldn't even recognize it as a mistake. That’s why I believe the impact is more serious.

I would appreciate it if you could take another look at F-15.


[05/01/2025 11:43] kartoonjoy
Hi there. Thank you for raising the concern. However, the PJQA period is reserved for SR wardens and has now ended.
